# Manual Installation

## Step 1: Install BepInEx 5
1. Download **BepInEx 5** (Mono version) for Windows x64 from the official [BepInEx GitHub releases](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases) (The file should be called something along the lines of `BepInEx_win_x64_5.x.x.x.zip`).
2. Copy & Paste the contents of the downloaded zip file into your Wobbly Life game folder.
   - The folder should look like this after extraction:
     ```
     Wobbly Life
     â”œâ”€â”€ BepInEx
     |   â”œâ”€â”€ core
     |   â””â”€â”€ ...
     â”œâ”€â”€ Mod Tools
     â”œâ”€â”€ MonoBleedingEdge
     â”œâ”€â”€ Wobbly Life_Data
     â”œâ”€â”€ changelog.txt
     â”œâ”€â”€ doorstop_config.ini
     â”œâ”€â”€ opengl32.log
     â”œâ”€â”€ steam_appid.txt
     â”œâ”€â”€ UnityCrashHandler64.exe
     â”œâ”€â”€ UnityPlayer.dll
     â”œâ”€â”€ version.txt
     â”œâ”€â”€ winhttp.dll
     â””â”€â”€ Wobbly Life.exe
     ```

## Step 2: Download lstwoMODS
1. Go to [lstwoMODS Releases](https://github.com/lstwo/lstwoMODS/releases) and download the latest version's files:
   - `lstwoMODS.dll` (in older versions this might be named `NotAzzamods.dll`)
   - `CustomItems.dll` (may not exist in older versions but required for future updates)

## Step 3: Download Required Dependencies
1. Download **ShadowLib** from its release page. You need these files:
   - `ShadowLib.dll`
   - `lstwo.shadowlib`
2. Download **UniverseLib** Mono version from its release page:
   - Get the zip file named `UniverseLib.Mono.zip`.
   - Extract it and copy the `UniverseLib.Mono` folder (containing `UniverseLib.Mono.dll` and `UniverseLib.Mono.xml`).

## Step 4: Install Plugins
1. Navigate to the `BepInEx/plugins` folder inside your Wobbly Life game folder.
2. Copy the following files into the `plugins` folder:
   - From `lstwoMODS`:
     - `lstwoMODS.dll` (or `NotAzzamods.dll` if using an older version)
     - `CustomItems.dll` (if available)
   - From **ShadowLib**:
     - `ShadowLib.dll`
     - `lstwo.shadowlib`
   - From **UniverseLib** (place the whole folder):
     - `UniverseLib.Mono/`

   Your `BepInEx/plugins` folder should look like this:
   ```
   Wobbly Life/BepInEx/plugins
     â”œâ”€â”€ UniverseLib.Mono
     |   â”œâ”€â”€ UniverseLib.Mono.dll
     |   â””â”€â”€ UniverseLib.Mono.xml
     â”œâ”€â”€ CustomItems.dll
     â”œâ”€â”€ lstwo.shadowlib
     â”œâ”€â”€ lstwoMODS.dll / NotAzzamods.dll
     â””â”€â”€ ShadowLib.dll
   ```

## Step 5: Launch the Game
- Run Wobbly Life. BepInEx should load the mod automatically.

## Troubleshooting
- If the mod does not load, ensure the files are in the correct `BepInEx/plugins` folder.
- Verify that you are using **BepInEx 5 Mono** and **UniverseLib Mono** (not IL2CPP).
- Check the BepInEx logs in `BepInEx/LogOutput.log` for any error messages.
- If it still doesn't load submit an issue [here](https://github.com/lstwo/lstwoMODS/issues)

# FAQ

- **Does it have a server player count changer?**

  No, just use [Larger Lobbies](https://www.nexusmods.com/wobblylife/mods/8) for that.

- **Why did you change the name? (No one actually asked that)**

  Because "Not Azzamods" is very confusing at times.
