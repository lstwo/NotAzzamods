# Automatic Installation

lstwoMODS now has an installer you can find [here](https://github.com/lstwoSTUDIOS/lstwoMODSInstaller/). If you scroll down to the ReadMe it should tell you how to set it up.
If that doesn't work try the manual installation:

# Manual Installation (try automatic first)

## Step 1: Install BepInEx 5
1. Download **BepInEx 5** (Mono version) for Windows x64 from the official [BepInEx GitHub releases](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases) (The file should be called something along the lines of `BepInEx_win_x64_5.x.x.x.zip`).
2. Copy & Paste the contents of the downloaded zip file into your Wobbly Life game folder.
   - The folder should look like this after extraction:
     ```
     Wobbly Life
     â”œâ”€â”€ BepInEx
     |   â”œâ”€â”€ core
     |   â””â”€â”€ ...
     â”œâ”€â”€ Mod Tools
     â”œâ”€â”€ MonoBleedingEdge
     â”œâ”€â”€ Wobbly Life_Data
     â”œâ”€â”€ changelog.txt
     â”œâ”€â”€ doorstop_config.ini
     â”œâ”€â”€ opengl32.log
     â”œâ”€â”€ steam_appid.txt
     â”œâ”€â”€ UnityCrashHandler64.exe
     â”œâ”€â”€ UnityPlayer.dll
     â”œâ”€â”€ version.txt
     â”œâ”€â”€ winhttp.dll
     â””â”€â”€ Wobbly Life.exe
     ```

## Step 2: Download lstwoMODS
1. Go to [lstwoMODS Releases](https://github.com/lstwo/lstwoMODS/releases) and download the latest version's files:
   - `lstwoMODS.dll` (in older versions this might be named `NotAzzamods.dll`)
   - `CustomItems.dll` (may not exist in older versions but required for future updates)

## Step 3: Download Required Dependencies
Download **ShadowLib** from its release page. You need these files:
   - `ShadowLib.dll`
   - `lstwo.shadowlib`

Download **Cinematic Unity Explorer** from its release page. You need this file:
   - `CinematicUnityExplorer.BepInEx5.Mono.zip`

Extract the zip file after downloading.

## Step 4: Install Plugins
1. Navigate to the `BepInEx/plugins` folder inside your Wobbly Life game folder.
2. Copy the following files into the `plugins` folder:
   - From `lstwoMODS`:
     - `lstwoMODS.dll` (or `NotAzzamods.dll` if using an older version)
     - `CustomItems.dll` (if available)
   - From **ShadowLib**:
     - `ShadowLib.dll`
     - `lstwo.shadowlib`
  - From **Cinematic Unity Explorer** (files contained in the zip file at `/plugins/CinematicUnityExplorer/`)
     - `CinematicUnityExplorer.BIE5.Mono.dll`
     - `UniverseLib.Mono`

   Your `BepInEx/plugins` folder should look like this:
   ```
   Wobbly Life/BepInEx/plugins
     â”œâ”€â”€ UniverseLib.Mono.dll
     â”œâ”€â”€ CinematicUnityExplorer.BIE5.Mono.dll
     â”œâ”€â”€ CustomItems.dll
     â”œâ”€â”€ lstwo.shadowlib
     â”œâ”€â”€ lstwoMODS.dll / NotAzzamods.dll
     â””â”€â”€ ShadowLib.dll
   ```

## Step 5: Launch the Game
- Run Wobbly Life. BepInEx should load the mod automatically.

## Troubleshooting
- If the mod does not load, ensure the files are in the correct `BepInEx/plugins` folder.
- Verify that you are using **BepInEx 5 Mono**, **UniverseLib Mono** and **Cinematic Unity Explorer BepInEx 5 Mono** (not IL2CPP).
- Check the BepInEx logs in `BepInEx/LogOutput.log` for any error messages.
- If it still doesn't load submit an issue [here](https://github.com/lstwo/lstwoMODS/issues)

# Building Yourself

If you want to get the latest and most unfinished features you can try to build it yourself.

1. Clone the repository
2. Open it in Visual Studio (or any other IDE / compiler)
3. Build the Project
4. Copy the lstwoMODS.dll from `<Project Folder>/bin/Debug/net46/` to `<Game Folder>/BepInEx/plugins/`

# FAQ

- **Does it have a server player count changer?**

  No, just use [Larger Lobbies](https://www.nexusmods.com/wobblylife/mods/8) for that.

- **Why did you change the name? (No one actually asked that)**

  Because "Not Azzamods" is very confusing at times.
